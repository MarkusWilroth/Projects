Hi

Here you can read some information about the projects I have chosen to add here.

The Projects:
- Friends (C++)
More info about this code can be found in the PDF "Friends" That exists in the folder "Friends"

- HumanitysLastChapter (C#)
This was one of my larger projects. The project was in the form of a game that I and four others developed.
I learned a lot from our many mistakes about how to succeed with a bigger project, especially how to
work with coordinations, Scrum and multiple important documents. You can read more about what I did in
the project and my thoughts about the development in the PDF "Individual Reflection" that exists in the
folder "HumaniytsLastChapter".

- KnapsackProblem (C#)
Solved the knapsackproblem with a greedy algorithm and with Neighbour Search

Used machine learning to create a behaviour tree for Pacman

- NotSoMobile (C++)
